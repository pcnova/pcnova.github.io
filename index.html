    Hello World! I am a Mexican-American software developer currently based out
    of the Mile High City. I intend this to be a space for sharing things I learn
    in my journey through the computing world as, primarily, a .NET developer.
    </p>

<p>
    Like many developers out there, I’ve been meaning to blog for quite a while,
    but I just never seemed to have the time or, quite frankly, the courage.
</p>

<p>
    However, I have finally reached the point where I feel experienced enough
    that I might have something of value to contribute. I have also learned so
    much from countless developers over the years that it’s only fair for me to
    contribute back.
