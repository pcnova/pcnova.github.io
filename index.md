Pcnova Init
===========

![Pcnova avatar](assets/pcnova_avatar.jpg) Hello World! I am a Mexican-American
software developer currently based out of the Mile High City. I intend this to
be a space for sharing things I learn in my journey through the computing world
as, primarily, a .NET developer.

Like many developers out there, I've been meaning to blog for quite a while, but
I just never seemed to have the time or, quite frankly, the courage.

However, I have finally reached the point where I feel experienced enough that I
might have something of value to contribute. I have also learned so much from
countless developers over the years that it's only fair for me to contribute back.

Hopefully you'll find some of my content useful. If you do, please share or
[follow]. [Happy coding] my friends!
